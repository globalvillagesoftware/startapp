>>> The module short description. Change it appropriately. <<<

>>> The module description follows here. <<<

This is based on code written by Fabio Zadrozny as a template in the `Pydev`
plugin for Eclipse. It provides the basic code that you need to start and run an
application.

There are four main stages in the startup process:

* Get the configuration that the application will use.
* Initialize gvLogging.
* Run the application.
* Dispose of exceptions that happen during the running of the application.

This code can be used in two ways:

* It may be used as a module template by the `pydev` plugin for the Eclipse
  IDE. It will be automatically installed in `pydev` if `pydev` is detected by
  the `startupapp` installation procedure.
* It may be used manually as a template for the application agnostic portion of
  a user application high level module.

>>> The sources where configuration information can be obtained. <<<

Each dictionary element can be an instance of the class configLoader that can
load configuration data for a specific group within an organization. It can
also be a dictionary of sources that are considered to be lower in the
organization hierarchy.

The key of each element should be the name of the organization group. The top
level entry in a hierarchy can use the organization name as a key.

The value for each configuration item is a tuple. The first member of the
tuple is the actual value of the configuration item. The second is a set of
flags that are mostly organization specific and are intended to define how the
configuration item can be used. These include a global flag that controls
whether lower level groups within an organization hierarchy can override the
value of the specific configuration item. If the value is a dictionary then it
contains a set of lower level organization definitions.

This dictionary is originally empty so no sources for configuration data are
supported.
