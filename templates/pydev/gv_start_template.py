This is based on code written by Fabio Zadrozny as a template in the `Pydev`
plugin for Eclipse. It provides the basic code that you need to start and run an
application.
 
There are four main stages in the startup process:
 
* Get the configuration that the application will use.
* Initilize logging.
* Run the application.
* Dispose of exceptions that happen during the running of the application.
 
This code can be used in two ways:
 
* It may be used as a module template by the `pydev` plugin for the Eclipse
  IDE. It will be automatically installed in `pydev` if `pydev` is detected by
  the `startupapp` installation procedure.
* It may be used manually as a template for the application agnostic portion of
  a user application high level module.
